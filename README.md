App.js is written in Node.js, it has the same function i.e. To find Armstrong, to run it you should have installed Node in your system,

I have written this code such that it takes input from command line arguments, 

So type : node app.js {Input} , eg. node app.js 11234 , 11234 is your input.

App.js also outputs the immediate higher and lower Armstrong number, in case the input is not Armstrong, additionaly it shows execution time and memory used on terminal.
